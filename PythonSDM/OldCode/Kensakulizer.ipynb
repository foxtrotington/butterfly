    "This program must reside within a fold that contains all species data in a csv format. It will then take that data and begin organizing it into the needed format for the SDM provided in class by jeff. Furthermore it then takes that data and breaks it down into a year by year and month by month format to allow for smaller packages to be ran with the sdm in parallel. This code can highly moduluar and able to be modified with ease to suit any formating needs or to only update data for specified months, years, or species. \n",
