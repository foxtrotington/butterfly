    "This code is used to make pull requests from inaturalist with authorization. It takes a list of taxonIds makes a dictionary out of it with taxonId as the key and the scientific name as the value. Then it gets the authorization via getaccesstoken to allow for pulling of all data rather than being capped. These two functions feed their data into dataPuller to iterate through the dictionary and use the authorization to pull each species data and store it in a list before writing it out to a taxonID titled csv with headers of id,location,observed_on, and time_observed_at as this is the only data we are interested in.\n",
