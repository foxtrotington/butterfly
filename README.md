# Midterm Make-Up Project

Our project is an accumluation of scripts that pull data from iNaturalist and complile them into a CSV file. This CSV file is then pushed into the Species Distribution Model provided by the clients and output a heat map based on a specified species and month/year. To allow it to be interactive we have accumlated the neccessary code into a Jupyter Notebook file which takes user input to output the SDM image from the specified year/month for the specified species. We have included all necessary documentation to go along with our scripts.


System Requirements: Software: Python 3.6, R, Anaconda, Bash, (Maybe Access to HPC) R Packages: rgdal, raster, sp, dismo, maptools

# Getting Started: (Gathering Data)

1. Clone everything from our github by running the command
   -> git clone https://github.com/foxtrotington/butterfly.git
2. Aquire data via
    Navigating to the PythonSDM folder -> cd butterfly/PythonSDM
    Then running the Final Request Solution script -> python Final_Request_Solution.py
3. Run the kensakulizer script to clean the data
    -> python kensakulizer.py

# How to Use: (Running the SDM)
1. Navigate to PythonSDM folder
    -> cd butterfly/PythonSDM
2. Run "get_observation_data_run_sdm.sh" 
    -> python get_observation_data_run_sdm.sh

You will see the SDM result divided by taxon id, year, and month in "output" folder on the root directory. If you see there is no folder for a certain month, then there was no observation data for that month for that certain taxon id.

If you just want the observation data from iNaturalist:
    Run "data-puller.py" -> python data_puller.py
You will get all observation raw data as csv files with the taxon id recorded in "taxon-id.txt".

# Runtimes:
	Estimated run time of gathering observation data via Final_Request_Solution.py: 46 minutes
	Estimated run time for running of the SDM: approximately 4 hours
